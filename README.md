openerp-freeswitch-connector
============================

Currently this is simply a fork of http://www.akretion.com/open-source-contributions/openerp-asterisk-voip-connector

Currently this project only adds the click to dial feature to customers, events, employees and applicants. It also only works (or at least is only tested) with OpenERP 7.

I will be doing the following over the next short while:
* Adding my copyright
* Adding documentation and updating comments to better reflect changes and how to use it
* Add click to dial every other place it makes sense
* Work on fetching the names for caller_id (this is rather straight forward, but I have several ways I am evaluating)
